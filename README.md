# College Basketball Free Throw Shooting

This project looks at the reliability of FT% in Division 1 Men's College Basketball. It explores how much a player's FT% in a given season reveals about their true talent for free throw shooting based on their number of free throw attempts. It also attempts to regress each player's observed FT% to the national average to approximate a player's free throw shooting skill.

Free Throw Shooting.R contains the code for loading all D1 Men's College Basketball play-by-play data from the 2017-18 season through the 2021-22 season. Also included is the code to load in roster data for each player, including their position, class, and conference. All the data loaded in this file is included in the Data folder.

Free Throw Shooting Report.Rmd contains the code for outputting a report for the analysis. The output is contained in the College Basketball Free Throw Shooting Report file.

Player FT Seasons.csv contains data for each player-season in the sample. It is one of the datasets created by running the Free Throw Shooting.R file.
