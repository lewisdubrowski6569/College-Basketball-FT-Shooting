# College Basketball Free Throw Shooting

This project looks at the reliability of FT% in Division 1 Men's College Basketball. It explores how much a player's FT% in a given season reveals about their true talent for free throw shooting based on their number of free throw attempts. It also attempts to regress each player's observed FT% to the national average to approximate a player's free throw shooting skill.
